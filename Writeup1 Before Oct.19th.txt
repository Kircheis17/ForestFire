1.1 The gameboard for Playing Fire

1.1.1 Read From Map

Open a file to read in the longitude, latitude and also the altitude.

The longitude and latitude should be the navigator of a cell. Just like the rows and column. So create a canvas behind the it.

Also, the altitude should representing the height of a grid itself. So that the contour can be draw as the gridline.

  In order to do that, the cell should be able to judge its neighbors to see whether they have higher or lower height than them. If the
  neighbors are higher. Then the contour shod be draw at the lower side( the side which is further from the higher neighbors).
  
1.1.2 Draw board Canvas

1.1.3 Draw Gridlines as contour(The testfile will released on Next Tuesday)

1.1.4 Coming up with dominant parameters
